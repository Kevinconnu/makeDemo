# makeDemo

This demo originated from <https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/>, then it was copied from <https://github.com/hoppersroppers/makeDemo>

You can check out the code located in the three files (hellomake.c, hellofunc.c, and hellomake.h and read the Makefile) to understand what is going on... or you can not. 

To get this to work, all you have to do is follow the instructions. 

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/Kevinconnu/makeDemo.git
2. cd into the directory
3. Run the command "make"

The executable 'hellomake' will have been built. Execute it like any normal file, using './hellomake'. 

Congratulations on building a program from source. I can't guarantee it will always be like this, but here is hoping!
